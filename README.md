This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), currently hosted on my own [domain](https://yingchaoooo.me/). Feel free to go have a look!

## What's it about
This project is a personal portfolio to showcase skills on frontend development, and to show my past experiences and projects, and really, just have a proper website for myself.

## What's inside
The project utilizes React, Next.js, tailwindcss for CSS, Sanity for CMS. 
Framer Motion is used to create animations and some other packages such as typewriter and icons to make the website just a bit nicer.

## Deploy on Vercel
As it's a Next.js app, it's deployed on Vercel.

## Others
Well, the thing about portfolio website is, I personally think it's definitely a good idea to have one. But while building your own portfolio websire, you tend to spend more time on CSS to make the website visually pleasing - it's your own website you'd want it to look nice wouldn't you.
But spending too much time on CSS doesn't really provides more skill growth after some extend. And a poorly designed website is gonna reflect poorly on our skills, even though you build the entire website from scratch all by yourself!
Anyways, it's a good learning experience!
